If you would like to use Formik with a UI framework, you'll probably want to create a wrapper component that binds Formik's props and callbacks.

A few popular frameworks have open source wrappers readily available:

- [Ant Design](https://github.com/jannikbuschke/formik-antd)
- [Fabric](https://github.com/kmees/formik-office-ui-fabric-react)
- [Material UI](https://github.com/stackworx/formik-material-ui)
- [Reactstrap](https://github.com/shoaibkhan94/reactstrap-formik)
- [Semantic UI](https://github.com/turner-industries/formik-semantic-ui)
