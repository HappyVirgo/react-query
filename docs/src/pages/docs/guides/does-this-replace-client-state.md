title: Does React Query replace Redux, MobX or other global state managers?
---

Well, let's start with a few important items:

- React Query is a **server-state** library, responsible for managing asynchronous operations between your server and client
- Redux, MobX, Zustand, etc. are **client-state** libraries that _can be used to store asynchronous data, albeit inefficiently when compared to a tool like React Query_

With those points in mind, the short answer is that React Query will likely replace _almost all of your **asynchronous** code that you currently pipe through your **client** state management library_.

For a vast majority of applications, the **client** state that is left over after migrating all of your async code to React Query is usually very miniscule. In rare cicurmstances, an application might indeed have a massive amount of synchronous client-only state (like a visual designer or music production application), in which case, you will probably still want a client state manager. And that's fine, you can use React Query along side client state managers without any issues!

So as _probable side-effect_, **yes**. React Query can replace Redux, MobX or any other global state manager, if you are primarily using it to cache your server-side data.

## A more detailed example

Here we have some "global" state being managed by a global state library:

```js
const globalState = {
  projects,
  teams,
  tasks,
  users,
  themeMode,
  sidebarOpen,
}
```

Currently, the global state manager is caching 4 types of server-state: `projects`, `teams`, `tasks`, and `users`. If we were to move these server-state assets to React Query, our remaining global state would look more like this:

```js
const globalState = {
  themeMode,
  sidebarOpen,
}
```

This also means that with a few hook calls to `useQuery` and `useMutation`, we also get to remove any boilerplate code that use to manage our server state eg.

- Connectors
- Action Creators
- Middlewares
- Reducers
- Loading/Error/Result states
- Contexts

With all of those things removed, you may ask yourself, **"Is it worth it to keep using our client state manager for this tiny global state?"**

**And that's up to you!**

But React Query's role is clear. It removes asynchronous wiring and boilerplate from your application and replaces it with just a few lines of code.

What are you waiting for, give it a go already!
